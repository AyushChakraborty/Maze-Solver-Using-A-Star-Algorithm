NAME: RAT IN A MAZE
PACKAGES USED: PYGAME, MATH

Rat Maze Solver Game This project is a rat maze solver game developed using Pygame and the A* pathfinding algorithm. The game provides a graphical user interface (GUI) with a main page where users can start the game. Upon starting, it transitions to the main game page where players can draw a maze on a grid. The A* algorithm is then employed to find the shortest path from the end point to the start point of the maze.

Features: GUI Interface: Interactive GUI allows users to draw mazes on a grid. A Pathfinding Algorithm:* Used to solve the maze from end to start point. Customizable Start and End Points: Users can select the starting and ending points for maze solving. Time Tracking: Displays the time taken to solve the maze upon completion.

Technologies Used: Pygame: Python library for game development. A Pathfinding Algorithm:* Implemented using Python. Python Libraries: pygame, math, sys.exit, PriorityQueue from queue.
